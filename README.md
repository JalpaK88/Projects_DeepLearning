**Driver’s Drowsiness Detection using Deep Learning:** 

**Dataset:** MRL Eye Dataset
**Description:** Evaluated a driver’s drowsiness detection system using the MRL dataset, demonstrating that the InceptionV3 model outperforms VGG16 under diverse conditions like illumination, reflection, and varying viewpoints. The results validate the higher accuracy and reliability of InceptionV3 in detecting drowsiness compared to VGG16.
**Key Findings:**
InceptionV3 outperformed VGG16 under challenging conditions such as illumination changes, reflections, and varying viewpoints.
Validated the higher accuracy and robustness of InceptionV3 for real-world drowsiness detection.
