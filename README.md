**Driver’s Drowsiness Detection using Deep Learning:** 
Evaluated a driver’s drowsiness detection system using the MRL dataset, demonstrating that the InceptionV3 model outperforms VGG16 under diverse conditions like illumination, reflection, and varying viewpoints. 
The results validate the higher accuracy and reliability of InceptionV3 in detecting drowsiness compared to VGG16.
